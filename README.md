# High-Resolution Exposome Mapping and Health Impact Assessment using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an innovative framework for high-resolution exposome mapping and health impact assessment using deep learning models. The study of environmental health and the exposome is crucial to understanding the complex interactions between environmental exposures and human health outcomes. Our approach addresses several challenges in traditional exposome mapping methods, including low spatial-temporal resolution, challenges in multi-modal data integration, and uncertainties in exposure quantification.

The core of our framework is the **Adaptive Multi-Scale Exposome Network (AMSEN)**, a hierarchical deep learning model that integrates diverse data streams (such as satellite imagery, wearable sensors, and geospatial data) and handles multi-scale variability and measurement uncertainties. The framework is complemented by the **Adaptive Exposure Optimization Strategy (AEOS)**, which optimizes model performance and accuracy through dynamic resource allocation, uncertainty-guided refinement, and domain-specific prior enforcement.

The methods introduced in this work offer significant advancements in exposome research, improving exposure prediction precision, computational performance, and providing insights for public health policymaking.
